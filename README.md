# ScrumAppTutorial

This project is intended to help me better understand IOS development and learning the language of Swift. 
This repository is following the official tutorial provided by Apple regarding getting started with learning iOS development and Swift.
I intend to use this project as a launching point for iOS development as it is something I am very interested in pursuing further.
